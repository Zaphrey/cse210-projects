This project is a simple fitness program that 
supports goal making and daily macro tracking.

Daily macros and calories can be saved and loaded
in as long as it's the same day they were logged in.
However, the trackers will get overwritten if any
of them are from a previous date as it only saves
the current trackers of the day.

This program has several menus within it which cover
the main portion, macro portion, and goal portion.

The main menu provides means to saving and loading data
to and from a text file which is prompted to the user.

The nutritional menu takes the user to the macro part of the program.
The log macros option in the menu asks the user for three values:
protein, carbohydrates, and fat in grams to add to the daily macro counter.
The log calores is similar to the log macro option, but only asks the user
for a caloric value to add to the daily calorie counter.

The goal menu takes the user to the goal part of the program.
The view goals option displays a list of the current goals stored within the program.
The create goal option prompts the user for a type of goal to create,
and prompts the user with inputs respective to each goal.
The log goal prompts the user to select a goal from the list of existing goals,
and completes the goal, or brings the user to one more step to completing it.
The weight goal also showcases a percentage to how close the user is
to their goal.
